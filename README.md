This project is no longer maintained, so please do not provide any pull requests.
Feel free to fork and become creative, though. :)

## What is Lys?

Lys is a programming language used to write high-level programs to control RGB LED`s in a self-built circuit board.

The project consists of a compiler which interpretes LYS code and outputs (for now) Javascript code ready to be executed in the included LysVM (in the browser).

By design, the library can be easily adapted to output pure C code which can be used to program the circuit board itself.
